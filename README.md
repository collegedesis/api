This API is currently home to the Directory and the News Board.
In the future, this API will only be for the Directory and the News board will be
a separate application built on top of the API combined with what is now known 
as [UI](http://github.com/collegedesis/ui).

## API

This API is useful to get a list of organizations like this:

#### Organizations

1. `/v1/organizations/`
2. `/v1/organizations/:id`
3. `/v1/organizations/search?:keyword`

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up the project locally to hack on.
