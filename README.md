This is the [CollegeDesis website](http://collegedesis.com). It's built on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com). The application is hosted on Heroku and uses Postgres in both development and production. 

To test it out, make sure you have Postgres on your system, `git clone`, `bundle`, `rake db:seed`, `rails s`, and then navigate to `localhost:3000`.

If you have any questions, tweet [@collegedesis](http://twitter.com/collegedesis) or email us at <brownkids@collegedesis.com>

Feel free to file issues and fork as well. We'll work on getting an official MO for contribution as well.
